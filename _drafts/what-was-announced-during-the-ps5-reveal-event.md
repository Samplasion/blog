It's currently 09:30PM UTC when I'm writing this and Sony's PS5 conference is over. Maybe you missed it, and want to know what was announced. Worry not, I've got you covered!

As you can see, we've got some big titles coming, as well as smaller ones.

<h3 class="is-title is-3">Design</h3>

The new console sports a design that, in my honest opinion, looks like a sci-fi Wi-Fi router positioned sideways. Obviously, that's my view, but nonetheless, this new console, only white for the time being, has a new, fluid design, highly contrasting with the squarish design of its predecessor.

As you can see, Sony planned 2 models to come out this year. The usual disc model is accompanied by a new disc-less "Digital Edition", the budget model.

Aside for being the optimal spot for dust, the PlayStation 5's white finish is most likely the only color we'll see in a while.

<h3 class="is-title is-3">Accessories</h3>

Sony released a plethora of accessories to the console. Namely:

* DualSense Charging Station
* HD Camera
* Pulse 3D Wireless Headset
* Media Remote

It seems to me like they're trying to appeal to everyone with this.

By the way, the DualSense has a USB-C connector:
