<h3 class="is-title is-3">Design</h3>

The new console sports a design that, in my honest opinion, looks like a sci-fi Wi-Fi router positioned sideways. Obviously, that's my view, but nonetheless, this new console, only white for the time being, has a new, fluid design, highly contrasting with the squarish design of its predecessor.

The usual disc model is accompanied by a new disc-less "Digital Edition", the budget model.
