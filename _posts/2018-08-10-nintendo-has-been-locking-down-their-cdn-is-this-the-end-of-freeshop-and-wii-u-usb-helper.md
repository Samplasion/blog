<p>Nintendo has locked down their CDN. This means that we will not be able to access their eShop servers anymore.</p><p>With Nintendo blocking our way to their titles, returning a <code>403 Forbidden</code> error, we have to return to the old method of downloading games from souces other than the eShop. This would also be the end of the ride for programs such as Wii U USB Helper and freeShop. Those, in fact, used to directly <strong>access</strong> Nintendo's server to get a list of titles and download them. But with Nintendo putting under lock and key their games, those programs are rendered useless.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2019/08/3ds-freeshop-come-installare-giochi-direttamente-dal-3ds.jpg" width="480" height="360"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2019/08/wii-u-usb-helper-game-downloader-0.jpg" width="1682" height="1011"></div></div></div><figcaption>We will remember the help those two programs have given.</figcaption></figure><p>That said, let's hope Nintendo doesn't do anything too crazy to block hacking.</p><p><a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/cdn-starts-being-locked-down-apparently.514351/" rel="nofollow"><em>Source</em></a></p>
