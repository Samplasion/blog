It's currently 09:30PM UTC of June 11 when I'm writing this and Sony's PS5 conference is over. Maybe you missed it, and want to know what was announced. Worry not, I've got you covered!

<h3 class="title is-3">Design</h3>

The new console sports a design that, in my honest opinion, looks like a sci-fi Wi-Fi router positioned sideways. Obviously, that's my view, but nonetheless, this new console, only white for the time being, has a new, fluid design, highly contrasting with the squarish design of its predecessor.

As you can see, Sony planned 2 models to come out this year. The usual disc model - a standard edition with a 4K Blu-Ray disc drive - is accompanied by a new disc-less "Digital Edition", the budget model, akin to the PS4 Slim (except it has no disc reader).

Both models sport a "super-fast SSD", which is an improvement against the Hard Disk the old model had.

Aside for being the optimal spot for dust, the PlayStation 5's white finish is most likely the only color we'll see in a while.

<h3 class="title is-3">Accessories</h3>

Sony revealed a plethora of accessories to the console. Namely:

* DualSense Charging Station
* HD Camera
* Pulse 3D Wireless Headset
* Media Remote

Here's the complete line-up:

It seems to me like they're trying to appeal to everyone with this.

By the way, the DualSense has a USB-C connector:

Sony has [officially confirmed](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/10/08/an-update-on-next-gen-playstation-5-launches-holiday-2020/) that the PS5 will release globally "in time for Holiday 2020", making it the perfect gift for your beloved children.

Anyway, jokes aside, it's all from me on this extraordinary day. Happy future gaming!
