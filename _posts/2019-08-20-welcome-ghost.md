<p>I've decided I wanted to change the blog's backend to something fresher and newer. That's why I've decided to switch to <strong>Ghost</strong>, an open-source, Node-powered, headless blog backend. It's got a full-fledged admin interface, out-of-the-box theme integration (some are paid, but eh), integrations and <strong>a web-based post maker</strong> (which is what I originally wanted to create for the old framework).<br>That's why I can say I'm particularly happy with this. One thing I should say is: if you want to do something like this on GH Pages, you'll have to follow an online guide with static site mirroring from the computer. But that's a minor annoyance.</p>
