<p>freeShop is a homebrew that makes easy to download games that you already own from Nintendo's servers, in an open-source way.</p><p>However, that said titles are stored in a file called <strong>encTitleKeys</strong>. This file is illegal to share and contains all user purchased titles. And here comes to play an homebrew called <strong>freeShop launcher</strong>. At start, that homebrew downloads the latest title keys from <a href="http://3ds.titlekeys.gq/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and then starts freeShop, allowing a download of all available <em>-and not-</em> titles on the eShop, even titles of the “Nintendo Ambassadors Program”.</p><p>freeShop makes it easy to download DLCs, too, in a GUI available in many languages. You can download freeShop <a href="https://freeshop.pw/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
