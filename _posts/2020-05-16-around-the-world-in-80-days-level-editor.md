<p>Ok, I know what you're thinking. <em>"But Samplasion, that is an old a55 game. Why are you still making stuff for this game?"</em>. Well because I like it. And because I feel like this game deserves more love.</p><p>This level editor is made using pure HTML, JS and CSS. Nothing else. This also means that the site will also work offline.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2020/05/Schermata-2020-05-08-alle-13.20.12.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Upon opening the site, you'll be greeted by a minimal file selector. Just open the file in <code>&lt;GameDir&gt;/Base</code>. On a normal installation, that'd be <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Around the World in 80 Days\Base\levels.xml</code>. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2020/05/Schermata-2020-05-08-alle-13.20.32.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Select this file</figcaption></figure><p>Once that's done, you'll see the Main Interfaceâ„¢.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2020/05/Schermata-2020-05-08-alle-13.20.46-1.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>There are 4 columns.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2020/05/Schermata-2020-05-08-alle-13.20.57.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The first column</figcaption></figure><p>This is the first column.

Be sure to select at least 3 of them or the game will crash trying to calculate a starting grid where the tiles don't match.

The picture shows the UI in Italian. The language is taken out of the user agent, so it's fully automatic and doesn't require a selector.</p><p><strong>Access the Level Editor at <a href="https://aw80dle.samplasion.js.org/">this link</a>.</strong> Oh, and by the way, <a href="https://github.com/Samplasion/aw80dle">this level editor is open source</a>, so come adding your fixes/features or translating it into your language! </p><p>And as always, be sure to comment what you think and share your creations with this tool.
