I've mentioned it multiple times in previous posts, but I feel like writing this post so I can just link to it when needed.

What are developer tools? Developer tools are a collection of commands (more than 50) that are commonly used by developers, such as `git`, `svn`, `perl` and other similar commands.

To install them, run:

{% capture code %}
xcode-select --install  
xcode-select: note: install requested for command line tools{% endcapture %}
{% include highlight.html lang="bash" code=code host="Users-Mac" output="2" %}

A new window should appear. Click on the **Install** button and wait for it to finish installing.

Now, when you run that command again, you'll get this:

{% capture code2 %}
xcode-select --install
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates{% endcapture %}
{% include highlight.html lang="bash" code=code2 host="Users-Mac" output="2" %}

That means they were successfully installed.

That's really it! If you were following a guide, [click here to go back](javascript:window.go(-1)).

Tell me what you think in the comments, and as always, stay safe!
