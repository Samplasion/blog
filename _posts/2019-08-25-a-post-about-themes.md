<p>I want to start off saying I really don't know what theme to use. I'd really just want to use either a Material Design theme or the old one, but I'm really out of ideas. And I'm out of luck, too, seeing as the only material theme is designed to work on Ghost 1.x. I guess my only choice will be to produce a theme myself...</p>
