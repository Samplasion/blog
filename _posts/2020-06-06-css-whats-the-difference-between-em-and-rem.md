<p>If you have tried working with CSS, you'll have noticed two special units: <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>. If you compute one of each on a blank HTML page, they compile the same — so what's the difference?</p><p>First of all, <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> are dynamic units. They scale depending on the font size. In fact, in a standard HTML page, where the default font size is 16px, <code>1em</code> and <code>1rem</code> both compile to 16px.</p><p>The difference lies in that little "r": it stands for <code>root</code>. The practical difference is that while <code>em</code> compiles to <code>px</code> using the element's <code>font-size</code> (or the inherited one), <code>rem</code> uses the one in the root element (<code>&lt;html&gt;</code>). It's also important to mention that <code>rem</code>s are just a CSS3 thing; they don't exist in previous versions.</p><p><code>em</code> refers to "the width of the letter M" because before the computer era, press typefaces usually made the uppercase M to be a "block" wide. Nowadays, the letter M is usually narrower than 1 em, but the terminology stayed.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)#History">One em was traditionally defined as the width of the capital <em>M</em> in the current typeface and point size, because the <em>M</em> was commonly cast the full-width of the square <em>blocks</em>, or <em>em-quads</em> (also <em>mutton-quads</em>), which are used in printing presses.<br><br>In modern typefaces, the character M is usually somewhat less than one em wide.</blockquote><figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)#History">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But why use <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>? Because the content should adjust to the size of the device, it is important that your font adjusts too.</p><p>You've gotta be careful with <code>em</code> though. Take this example:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe id="cp_embed_dyYaQZJ" src="https://codepen.io/samplasion/embed/preview/dyYaQZJ?height=300&amp;slug-hash=dyYaQZJ&amp;default-tabs=html,result&amp;host=https://codepen.io" title="" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="300" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></figure><p>Even though you set the <code>font-size</code> on the <code>p</code> element to <code>1em</code>, it inherited the <code>div</code>'s <code>2rem</code> <code>font-size</code> and used it to calculate its own <code>1em</code> <code>font-size</code>, resulting in 16px * 2rem * 1em = 32px. Had we used <code>1rem</code> on it instead, it would've been half the size:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe id="cp_embed_jObdQXP" src="https://codepen.io/samplasion/embed/preview/jObdQXP?height=300&amp;slug-hash=jObdQXP&amp;default-tabs=html,result&amp;host=https://codepen.io" title="Em vs rem pt 2" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="300" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></figure><p>Alright, that's it for today's story. Happy programming!</p>
