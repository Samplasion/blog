<p>It's only been a little more than a couple weeks since the release of the new Nintendo Switch Lite, and it's already been found that its sticks are the same as its big brother's. This means the new portable console might (or I'd say <em>will</em>) have the same drifting problems the regular Switch had, but made worde by the fact you can't simply go to the store and purchase another pair of JoyCons, you actually have to send your console over to Nintendo to fix it.</p><p>The point is, they had more than enough time to fix it. And they didn't. They've kept the same, old flawed joysticks of 2 years ago. Well, at least they offer free fixing...</p>
