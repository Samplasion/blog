<p>Yesterday I got SMB 3Mix in my Nintendo 3DS, injected in a <code>.cia</code> by a program called <strong>Ultimate NES VC Injector for 3DS</strong>. What this program basically does is, in order, taking a <code>.nes</code> rom, taking its data from a database or custom data <em>(title, short title, publisher and icon)</em>, selecting a banner, a Title ID and a screen mode and, finally, injecting it all in a CFW-installable <code>.cia</code>.</p>
